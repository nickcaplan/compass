# Decisions

## 2026-10-31 - Repository is private

The repo touches a client's commercial project, so it is private under
nickcaplan. No real rates or customer data are held here regardless; the
demo's content is illustrative.

## 2026-10-31 - React + Vite + TypeScript, static build

Matches the agreed system design (private briefing doc, 31 Oct 2026): the
front end is React/Vite static files; the backend, PostgreSQL database and
PDF worker arrive with the prototype. This repo contains only the front end.

## 2026-10-31 - Render for hosting

Nick chose Render on 31 Oct 2026. The demo deploys as a Render static site
(free tier); the later backend and managed PostgreSQL can live on the same
platform, so nothing needs rewiring. The same static build can move hosts if
that changes.

## 2026-10-31 - Illustrative figures scale linearly from the brief's example

The brief's example scenario is Performance / Lead generation / Procurement /
Manager + Director / GBP 100,000 / 12 weeks. When the demo user enters a
different budget, plan figures scale linearly from that reference so the plan
always reconciles with the brief entered. This is deliberately simple and
labelled illustrative on screen; the real planning engine is a later step
with its own correctness tests.

## 2026-10-31 - Inert actions say so

Save plan, Download PDF, Speak to a specialist, Sign in, My plans and Support
show a note that they are part of the full product. This keeps the demo
honest: nothing implies a working backend that does not exist.

## 2026-10-31 - Four seniority levels from the brief

The mockups showed three; the brief (section 7) lists four: Technician /
Practitioner, Manager, Senior Manager / Head, Director / Executive. The demo
implements the brief's four.

## 2026-10-31 - Objective, KPI and audience are multi-select

A campaign brief can span several objectives, KPIs and audiences, so those
fields are multi-select. KPI options are the union of the selected
objectives' KPIs; deselecting an objective drops only the KPIs that no
remaining objective offers, and re-selecting does not restore them silently.
When several objectives are selected the plan composes one illustrative set
of activities from all of them, deduplicated, with the budget re-split so
spends still sum exactly to the entered budget; headline metrics are the
union of each objective's highlighted figures. Selection order carries no
priority.

## 2026-10-31 - Campaign dates must not be in the past

A plan that starts in the past is not useful, so the start date must be
today or later and the end date no earlier than the start. A campaign
starting today is allowed; anything earlier shows a warning and the brief
does not count as ready.
